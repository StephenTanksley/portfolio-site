          My name is Stephen Tanksley and I'm an audio designer who codes. I got
          into web development originally because I wanted a job that would pay
          more reliably than freelance music. Now that I'm here, I can't help
          but see the web for what it can be: A big audio playground with tons
          of untapped potential.

          When I'm not designing websites or reading about algorithms and data
          structures, I'm writing music and designing sounds for synthesizers,
          commercials, film, TV and games.
